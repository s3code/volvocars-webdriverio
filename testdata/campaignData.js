    "After we introduced the 3-point safety belt, we faced a world of criticism. Since then, it has saved more than a million lives. Now it's time for the next step. For everyone's safety.",
  speedCap:
    "To send a strong signal about the dangers of speeding, we reduced the top speed of all our new cars to 180 km/h in 2020. We are also looking at how smart speed control and geofencing technology could automatically limit speeds near schools and hospitals in the future.",
  highwayPilot:
    "With support from LiDAR sensors, the next generation of Volvo cars will be hardware-ready for autonomous drive. And over time, we will push out over-the-air software updates to provide fully autonomous highway driving.",
  driverMonitoringCameras:
    "To help address intoxication and distraction in traffic, we are working on new in-car solutions. Driver monitoring cameras, together with other sensors, will allow the car to intervene when a clearly intoxicated or distracted driver risks serious injury or death.",
  careKey:
    "We've recently introduced the Care Key, aimed at addressing speeding. With the Care Key, Volvo car owners can put a speed cap on the car when lending it to a younger family member or less experienced driver as a way of ensuring a safer ride.",
